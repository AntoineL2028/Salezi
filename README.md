## üìù Overview

The Cloudly Backend project is the backend application for Cloudly, a platform providing an API for managing stocks and sales of products for FNAC's sales partners. The project includes three different roles: Super Admin, FNAC Manager, and Seller, with role-based access control for enhanced security. The backend is built using Strapi with an SQLite database.

A category of items is referred to a "collection." Each collection comprises a set of individual products, and each product is characterized by a set of attributes. These attributes may include simple characteristics or more intricate ones, which are denoted as components and, in turn, consist of their own set of attributes.

3 collections are already created in the system so that you can see an example of how the system works. These collections are: Books, CDs and Electronics.
